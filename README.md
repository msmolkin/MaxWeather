# Weather Report Scraper

This repository contains a Python script to scrape weather reports from the National Weather Service website. The script uses the `requests` library to fetch the data, `BeautifulSoup` to parse the HTML, and `concurrent.futures` for parallel processing.

## Features

- Fetch weather reports for multiple locations.
- Use concurrent processing to speed up data retrieval.
- Log the process with timestamps and log levels.
- Copy the weather report to the clipboard using `pyperclip`.

## Requirements

- Python 3.6+
- `requests` library
- `beautifulsoup4` library
- `pyperclip` library
- `tqdm` library

You can install the required libraries using the following command:

```sh
pip install requests beautifulsoup4 pyperclip tqdm
```

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/weather-report-scraper.git
cd weather-report-scraper
```

2. Create a dictionary with the location information:

```python
location = {
    'site': 'SITE_CODE',
    'issuedby': 'ISSUED_BY',
    'product': 'PRODUCT_CODE',
    'format': 'FORMAT_CODE',
    'version': 'VERSION_NUMBER'
}
```

3. Run the script:

```sh
python weather-report-scraper.py
```

## Functions

### `create_url_from_location_dict(location)`

Creates the URL for a given location using the location dictionary.

**Args:**
- `location` (dict): The dictionary containing the location information.

**Returns:**
- `str`: The URL for the location's weather reports page.

### `get_weather_report(location, version)`

Fetches the weather report for a given location and version.

**Args:**
- `location` (dict): The dictionary containing the location information.
- `version` (str): The version of the weather report.

**Returns:**
- `str`: The weather report.

## Logging

The script uses the `logging` module to log information with timestamps and log levels. The log format is:

```
%(asctime)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s
```
